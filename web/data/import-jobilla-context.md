# The Jobilla Primer: Core Function and Goals

This document provides a clear, concise overview of Jobilla's business model, objectives, digital marketing campaigns rules, frameworks and brand voice.

## What Jobilla Does

Jobilla is a recruitment technology and marketing company. Its primary function is to help other businesses (its clients) find and hire qualified job candidates.

The core of its method is a modern digital marketing funnel, which works in three main steps:

1.  **Advertisement**: Jobilla creates and places targeted ads on social media platforms (like Facebook and Instagram) to reach potential candidates. This includes people who are not actively looking for a new job ("passive candidates").
2.  **Landing Page**: When a person clicks the ad, they are taken to a custom landing page. This page is designed to be engaging and quickly explain the benefits of the job and the company.
3.  **Questionnaire**: Instead of asking for a CV, the landing page invites the candidate to take a short, 3-5 minute questionnaire. This form asks questions relevant to the job to quickly assess if there is a mutual fit.

In short, Jobilla runs end-to-end digital recruitment campaigns on behalf of its clients, managing everything from content creation to candidate qualification.

## What Jobilla's Goals Are

Jobilla's objectives can be understood from three perspectives: for its clients, for the candidates, and for the market itself.

* **For Clients**: The main goal is to solve hiring challenges efficiently. This means reducing the time it takes to hire someone, improving the quality of candidates, and finding talent that traditional methods (like job boards) would miss.
* **For Candidates**: A key goal is to create a better, more respectful application experience. By removing the need for a CV upfront and using a quick, relevant questionnaire, Jobilla aims to make the process faster, more engaging, and less biased for job seekers. This is their "candidate-centric" philosophy.
* **For the Recruitment Market**: Jobilla's ultimate goal is to disrupt outdated recruitment practices. They aim to prove that a proactive, marketing-based approach is more effective than the passive "post and pray" model of traditional job boards, especially in winning the modern "war for talent."

## The Jobilla Funnel: A Precise Description

The Jobilla funnel is a three-stage digital recruitment process designed to guide a potential candidate from initial awareness to qualification.

* **The Ad (Attention)**: The process begins with a targeted social media ad (on platforms like Facebook and Instagram) that captures the attention of both active and passive candidates.
* **The Landing Page (Persuasion)**: When a candidate clicks the ad, they are directed to a landing page. This page informs them about the role's benefits and the company culture, convincing them to take the next step.
* **The Questionnaire (Qualification)**: Instead of a traditional CV submission, the final stage is a short, 3-5 minute questionnaire. Its purpose is to efficiently qualify the candidate by assessing if there is a mutual fit for the position.

# Campaign Creation Guide

This guide explains how to build Jobilla Digital Headhunting (DH) campaigns. It is based on the Jobilla concept and uses information from provided internal documents. Follow these steps to create effective campaigns.

## 1. Introduction: The Jobilla DH Concept

### What Makes Jobilla Campaigns Different?

Jobilla campaigns focus on making it easy for candidates to apply and efficient for recruiters to process applications.

**Easier for Candidates:**
* We target ads only to people likely interested.
* We talk about opportunities (what you get), not requirements.
* Applying is easy with a few simple questions.
* Candidates get immediate feedback on their suitability (A, B, C score).

**More Efficient for Recruiters:**
* Ads target professionals in the field.
* The questionnaire focuses on required skills, education, and experience.
* Scoring makes it easy to see who to contact first.

### The Candidate-Driven Approach

This means we communicate differently with potential candidates.
* **Talk like a friend**: The company and candidate are on the same level.
* **Highlight benefits**: Focus on what the candidate gets if they switch jobs. Ask "Why are we better than others?" Mention non-material benefits (like work pace).
* **Never talk about requirements** on the landing page or ads. Key skills are checked in the questionnaire.
* **No promise of a job**, but no rejection if skills aren't perfect (unless a specific skill is absolutely mandatory).
* **Use images** that attract and inspire potential candidates.
* **Keep it short and easy**: The landing page and questionnaire should be quick to complete.
* **Target passive candidates**: Make applying feel effortless.

### Overview of the Campaign Creation Workflow

1.  Gather necessary information (job details, criteria, company info, assets).
2.  Create Visual Ads.
3.  Design the Landing Page.
4.  Build the Questionnaire (including Attributes and Scoring).
5.  Set up Result and Thank You pages.
6.  Launch and monitor the campaign.

### Checklist: Core Jobilla Principles

## 2. Visual Ad Creation

### How to Make Performing Visual Ads

#### Media/Image Selection

#### Essential Content

* **Company Introduction**: Brief description, what it's like to work there.
* **What the Candidate Gets**: Focus on employment benefits, unique attractions, development opportunities.
* **Role Appeal**: Why is this role interesting?
* **Call to Action**: Make it obvious how to proceed.
* **Privacy Statement**: Assure candidates their data is handled correctly.

#### Language & Tone

* Match the candidate-driven approach (friendly, focus on benefits).
* Adapt tone (e.g., relaxed, businesslike, humorous) based on client request.
* Use appropriate formal/informal language based on region (e.g., German Sie/du/Du). Reference templates for examples.

#### Do's

* **DO** keep the text concise and easy to scan.
* **DO** match the visual style and message of the ad.
* **DO** have a clear, prominent Call to Action button.

- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the role/company?
- [ ] Is the Call to Action clear and easy to find?
- [ ] Is there a privacy statement?
- [ ] Does the overall look match the ad?

## 4. Questionnaire Construction

### How to Create an Effective Questionnaire

The questionnaire gathers key information and helps score candidates.

#### Recommended Structure

A typical structure includes questions about:
* (Optional: Character/candidate-driven opening question)
* Years of work experience
* Specific job duties / skills
* Education
* Language skills
* Required cards/licenses/special training (e.g., driving license, VCA)
* Specialist skills ("unicorn" skills)
* (Optional: Candidate-driven closing question, e.g., "What do you value?")

#### Using Attributes & Scoring Effectively

Attributes are used to automatically grade candidates based on their answers.

* **What are Attributes?** They represent key criteria for the job (e.g., "Experience Level", "Specific Skill", "Required License"). The system uses answers linked to attributes to calculate a score.
* **Attribute Types**:
    * **Scaled**: Used when there are levels of suitability (e.g., experience years: Excellent, Good, Average, Poor). Usually, 3 levels are enough.
    * **Boolean**: Used for Yes/No criteria (e.g., "Has Driving License?").
* **Scoring Logic Explained**:
    * **A**: Candidate meets all essential requirements.
    * **B**: Candidate is almost suitable (missing 1 or more required attributes).
    * **C**: Candidate is unsuitable (meets none of the 'A' criteria OR fails a "Disqualified if not met" requirement).
    * **A+**: Candidate meets all 'A' criteria AND has a specific desired special skill.
* **Disqualification Rules**: You can mark an attribute answer as "Disqualified if not met". If a candidate chooses this answer, they automatically become 'C', regardless of other answers. Use this for absolute must-haves (e.g., required degree/license).
* **Setting up A+ Attributes**: In the attribute settings, you can define a level that counts towards an A+ score (e.g., "Ideally to be at least Yes"). Link this to the relevant answer option in the question.
* **Creating Attributes in the System**:
    * Attributes are created under "Job Details" in the Jobilla platform.
    * Use the correct category: Education & Licenses, Skills & Experience, Personality, Availability.
    * Click "+ Add an attribute". Choose Boolean or Scaled. Name it clearly. Define options (for Scaled).
* **Important**: Do not rename attributes used in previous campaigns. Create new ones if needed.
* **Tip**: Keep the attribute setup as simple as possible. Complexity often makes it harder for the recruiter. Only create attributes for genuine needs, usually for hard facts like experience, education, specific essential skills/tasks. Avoid rating character questions unless directly critical for the job.

#### Question Style & Content

* Keep questions clear, simple, and quick to answer.
* Use multiple-choice questions where possible.
* Ensure answer options cover all likely scenarios, including "No experience" or "Does not apply".
* For multi-select questions where having no experience is important, create a specific "No Experience" Boolean attribute and link it to the "I don't have experience" answer option.

#### Standard Contact Questions

Always include standard questions at the end to collect contact details:
* Name (First and Last)
* Email Address
* Phone Number
* Consent question (asking permission to contact them about the role)

#### Handling Multiple Languages/Regions

* Use the provided standard questions for contact info in the target language.
* Follow the translation process guidelines if translating a full campaign.

#### Result & Thank You Page Content

Set up the pages shown after the candidate submits the questionnaire.
* **Result Page**: Shows the candidate their score (A+, A, B, C, or "?") and a corresponding message. This is where contact details are collected.
* **Thank You Page**: Confirms submission and may include a link to the company website.

#### General Advice

* Focus attributes on hard facts (experience, education, essential skills).
* Don't make the scoring too complex.
* Ensure questions and answers directly relate to the job's key criteria.

### Questionnaire Checklist

- [ ] Does the questionnaire follow the recommended structure?
- [ ] Are attributes created for key requirements?
- [ ] Is the scoring logic (A/B/C/A+) set up correctly?
- [ ] Are disqualification rules used appropriately for must-haves?
- [ ] Are questions clear and easy to understand?
- [ ] Do answer options cover all possibilities?
- [ ] Are standard contact questions (Name, Email, Phone, Consent) included at the end?
- [ ] Is the language/tone appropriate for the region and role?
- [ ] Are the Result and Thank You page messages configured?

# QA Rules

This document captures the first iteration of our AI‑assisted quality‑assurance framework for automatically generated Jobilla campaigns. It is meant as a single checklist our models (and humans!) can follow to ensure every asset that reaches a candidate is on‑brand, accurate and compliant.

## Meta Analysis (Whole‑Campaign)

* **Consistency across touchpoints** – Confirm the Feed, Story, Landing Page and Questionnaire tell the same story.
* **Factual & grammatical accuracy** – End‑to‑end fact check; correct typos and grammar before publishing.
* **Style & tone** – Verify brand voice is uniform across every asset.
* **Positive‑tone wording** – Language remains encouraging; disqualifying options or requirements phrased gently (e.g., “Not ideal” instead of “Unsuitable”).
* **Humor appropriateness** – Any humor aligns with audience and brand; avoid stereotypes or sensitive jokes.
* **Language & localization** – All assets use the same primary language and are fully translated; CTAs and questionnaire labels match the ad language.
* **Ansprache!**

## Ad Copy (Primary Text)

* **Attention‑grabbing opener** – Start with a hook that sparks curiosity while staying professional.
* **Concise & factual** – Keep copy short (≤ 90 characters before truncation in Meta ads) and stick to verifiable facts and true benefits.
* **Benefit‑first** – Emphasise why the role is attractive; leave requirements for the questionnaire.
* **No salary disclosure** – Pay ranges belong on the LP (or where legally required); omit them from ad copy unless explicitly instructed.
* **CTA alignment** – End with a prompt such as “Take the 60‑sec test” that matches the CTA button; never “Apply” or close variants.
* **Tone & accuracy** – Candidate‑driven, friendly, on‑brand; every claim must be traceable to client‑approved information.

## Feed (Single‑Image / Carousel Ads)

* **Layout legibility** – Title and subtitle must be readable on desktop and mobile; watch line‑breaks and font sizes.
* **Title & subtitle precision** – Keep within ~30 characters; focus on benefits, maintain factual accuracy, and mirror the LP headline.
* **Contrast** – Overlay text must meet WCAG AA contrast against the background image.
* **Safe‑zone & padding** – Keep headline, logo and CTA inside a center 4:5 crop (portrait safe‑zone) with ≥ 6 % internal padding so text stays fully visible and legible when a landscape creative is auto‑displayed in portrait feeds (e.g., Instagram).
* **Realism, anatomy & AI artefacts** – Count the fingers on every visible hand; flag distorted limbs, uncanny faces, or generative artefacts such as visual glitches, duplicated body parts or extra limbs.
* **Brand voice** – Copy must reflect the company’s agreed tone and style.
* **CTA compliance** – Encourage actions like “Take the test” or “Learn more”. Never use Apply, Application or close variations.
* **No hallucinated logos** – Remove random branding on clothing, equipment or vehicles.
* **Job‑title accuracy** – Creative wording is fine, but it must describe the real role.
* **Description accuracy** – Storytelling is welcome; facts cannot change.
* **Location precision** – A city/region (or explicit “Remote/Hybrid”) is mandatory; ambiguity is a blocker.
* **Placeholder purge** – Flag any leftover lorem ipsum, “{{ variable }}” tokens or blank fields.
* **DACH**: Testen Sie jetzt, ob diese Stelle zu Ihnen passt. (default wenn nicht was cooles)
* **DACH**: Benefits als Titeln (als Untertitel, besonders Mobiles / Flexibles / Remote + Quereinsteiger)
* **DACH**: BITTE ACHTEN AUF TITTELN DEUTSCHE SPRACHE IST WURST SPRACHE. TEXT MUSS KLEINER SEIN

## Story (9:16 Vertical Ads)

All Feed rules apply plus:
* **Safe‑zone check** – Core content stays within the 1080 × 1920 safe area (top & bottom 250 px reserved for UI).
* **Title/subtitle & CTA placement** – Follow Feed rules for precision and legibility; overlay text must sit inside the safe zone and stay readable on small screens.
* **Portrait adaptation** – Visuals are correctly cropped; no heads or limbs cut.
* **Upscaling artefacts** – Look for noise, ghosting or halo edges introduced during 9:16 conversion.

## Landing Page (LP)

* **Copy fidelity** – The description matches the official job ad. Raise questions on unclear or conflicting facts.
* **Benefits accuracy** – Perks listed must be available & verifiable.
* **Tone of voice** – Consistent with brand identity.
* **Regulatory compliance** – Salary range disclosure is already best practice and mandatory from 1 June 2026 under the EU Pay Transparency Directive. Flag any missing range.
* **Location clarity** – City/region shown; remote/hybrid stated explicitly.
* **CTA policy** – Same as Feed: never “Apply”.
* **Headline continuity** – LP headline aligns with the ad headline to keep the narrative coherent.
* **Privacy statement** – A concise note on data handling is present and visible near the CTA.
* **Styling check** – Colours, fonts and spacing follow Jobilla campaign design specs.

## Questionnaire

* **Relevance (friction‑lite)** – Ask only the minimum data needed to contact and qualify: mandatory education (if required in the Job Description), relevant work experience, key skills. Consent, name, email and phone are always mandatory.
* **Sufficiency** – Flag missing critical questions.
* **Brevity** – Limit to ≤ 6 assessment questions for entry‑level roles or ≤ 10 for senior roles (four mandatory contact & consent fields are excluded). Keep answer options concise and scannable.
* **Wording clarity** – Plain language; avoid double‑barrelled items. When style and clarity collide, choose clarity. Maintain campaign‑cohesive formality.
* **Complexity** – Language difficulty and technical terminology must suit the role’s seniority: entry‑level forms use accessible, non‑jargon wording; senior‑level forms may include more specialized terms. Ensure wording stays mobile‑friendly and consistent with the overall campaign.
* **Language match** – Questionnaire language aligns with ads & LP; no mixed-language prompts.
* **Specificity** – Verify that no question bundles more than one distinct skill (e.g., “Python” and “TypeScript”). Where granular proficiency matters, require separate questions; otherwise, flag for revision.
* **Specificity ⇆ Brevity trade‑off** – If the job description does not require separate skill‑depth assessment, bundling may be acceptable to stay under the 8/10‑question limit; if it does, split bundled skills into individual questions.
* **Job Description alignment** – Flag any question that is not directly traceable to requirements or information mentioned in the job description.
* **Qualification‑value integrity** – Every option carries a qualification value −1/0/1; use −1 (DISQUALIFYING) solely for explicit deal‑breakers stated in the JD.
* **Schema & tag compliance** – Order must be: assessment → contact_consent → contact info. Confirm max=1 for single‑choice questions, correct tags (name, email, phone), and valid option IDs for consent (yes | maybe | no).
* **Mobile legibility** – Questions and answer sets must be readable on a phone screen; avoid paragraphs or “wall of text” options.
* **Main headaches in DACH could be avoided if we check for:**
    * consistency in Ansprache
    * gendering (m/w/d)
    * Not mentioning 'ansprache'

# Candidate Driven Approach

## Jobilla Candidate-driven Specifications 2025

**Ver. 0.9 - 06082025**

### Purpose of This Document

This document serves to align and unify our shared understanding of the Candidate-Driven approach—an essential element of the Jobilla Story. It represents a core pillar of our brand identity, customer promise, and strategic narrative. At its heart, Candidate-Driven is more than just a methodology; it is one of Jobilla’s key differentiators and a unique selling point that reflects our vision across the entire Jobilla Group. By placing candidates at the center of the recruitment experience, we reinforce the value we bring to our clients and communicate our commitment to transforming how talent is engaged in the modern hiring landscape.

### What is Candidate Driven?

In recruitment, "candidate-driven" refers to a job market condition where job seekers have more power and influence in the hiring process due to high demand for talent and limited supply of qualified candidates.

This means:
* Candidates can be selective about job opportunities
* Employers must compete to attract and retain talent
* Job seekers often receive multiple offers
* Companies need to offer better compensation and benefits
* The hiring process tends to focus more on candidate experience

Essentially it’s about: **All information immediately vs. fragmenting data collection.**

Real candidate-driven way of sharing information & asking questions focus on what candidates genuinely need to know:
* Actual day-to-day responsibilities
* Clear growth opportunities and learning paths
* Team dynamics and management style
* Concrete examples of projects/challenges
* Flexibility and autonomy levels

Soft, low-value information & questions:
* Often waste candidates' time
* Sometimes create false expectations
* Don't help candidates make informed decisions
* Provide no actionable data for either party

### Better definition of "candidate-driven":

* Information & questions that help candidates evaluate fit realistically, with low effort
* Information that enables informed career decisions
* Content that respects candidates' time and intelligence
* Data points that both parties can act upon
* Questions that reveal mutual expectations

Being candidate-driven doesn't mean being just soft or vague, it means helping candidates make informed and low-barriered decisions while gathering meaningful data for hiring decisions –> **Little decisions step by step when both parties get more information!**

### Core principles for truly candidate-driven questions:

* **Reciprocal value**
    * Questions should help both parties assess fit
    * Answers should be actionable for both candidate and recruiter
    * Information gathered should directly relate to job success
* **Respect for time**
    * Each question should have a clear purpose
    * Answers should help candidates self-select in/out
    * Questions should be specific enough to prevent generic responses
* **Reality-based assessment**
    * Focus on real scenarios instead of hypotheticals
    * Ask about actual experiences rather than theoretical situations
    * Include context about real challenges they'll face
* **Future-focused development**
    * Questions about growth should be specific to your company's opportunities
    * Discuss concrete learning paths rather than vague aspirations
    * Connect candidate's goals with actual company initiatives

### 🚩Red flags that a question isn't truly candidate-driven:

* Can be answered with generic platitudes
* Doesn't relate to actual job requirements
* Provides no useful information for decision-making
* Could be answered the same way for any job
* Cannot be verified or measured

# QC Framework

## How to keep an eye on the quality of our campaigns?

Let’s picture a situation where you are a potential candidate, scrolling on your phone and you see an interesting ad picture. It has something that catches your eye, it’s easy to read and relates to something you might want to do in the future? Maybe something you do not have right now in your job. You click the ad, fill out an easy and quick test and someone calls you in a couple of days. This is the situation we want. In order for this to happen, there are few points you should keep eye on while building a campaign!

### DO’S and DONT’S

* Pictures, short text and easy to read. Call To Action!
* Landing page short and easy to read, not requirements, those will come out in the questionnaire.
* Never “Apply”
* Questionnaire approximately 5 to 6 questions, make multiselections if needed more!
* Remember to add the attributes! Minimum 2 attributes per questionnaire. They are not needed in every question, but each question needs its own attribute if you want to have one.
* Check the consent question, does it make sense?
* Result pages, correct texts and open question(s) if needed!

**Don’ts in visuals**
* Texts or logos over people’s heads/faces, badly positioned image etc.

## ✅ Jobilla Campaign QA: LP, Questionnaire & Ads

### 🖼️ 1. Visual Ads (Feed & Story)

**General:**
* **Headline & subtitle**: highlight real, factual benefits if possible.
* **Layout & text legibility**: Mobile-first! No crowding or hard-to-read fonts.
* **Text contrast**: General contrast rules (background vs. text).
* **Visual realism**: Check fingers, faces, limbs. Flag any AI glitches or distortions.
* **Brand fit**: Copy tone, design, and message must match the client's brand.

**Story-specific (9:16 vertical):**
* **No upscaling noise**: Look for ghosting or halo edges.
* **Same copy & style as Feed.**

**Common Don’ts:**
* No “Apply” CTAs.
* No unnecessary/generated fake logos (e.g., fake branding on shirts or vehicles).
* No placeholders (“{{ variable }}”, lorem ipsum, etc.).
* Location required – state city/region or explicitly “Remote/Hybrid”.

### 🌐 2. Landing Page (LP)

* **Same story as ad**: Headline and content must continue the campaign narrative.
* **Content must match official Job Description**: Raise flags if unclear, vague or inconsistent.
* **Benefits-driven**: Highlight perks, development, and workplace culture (✔ bullet points).
* **Short & clear**: Avoid long paragraphs. No job requirements here!
* **Visual consistency**: Fonts, colors, and layout must align with Feed ad design.
* **CTA = “Start the test”** or similar. Never “Apply.”
* **Privacy statement**: Mandatory and placed near the CTA.
* **Salary info**: Include if required (mandatory EU-wide from June 2026).
* **Location**: Must clearly state city/region; Remote/Hybrid only if verified.

### 📝 3. Questionnaire

**Keep it short:**
* **Entry-level**: Max 6 assessment questions
* **Senior roles**: Max 9 (excl. contact fields)

**Essential info only:**
* Ask only what’s needed to contact & qualify: skills, experience, education, licenses.

**Clarity > style:**
* Use plain language, avoid jargon unless senior-level. No double-barreled questions.

**A/B/C scoring logic:**
* **A** = Meets all qualifications
* **B** = Mostly meets qualifications
* **C** = Lacks critical items
* **A+** = Meets all qualifications + bonus (desired but not required) skill, add to only one, maximum two (2) questions!

* Match campaign tone & language.
* Use only one language per campaign. Match ad & LP language.

**Specificity vs. brevity:**
* Split bundled skills if the JD demands depth.
* It’s okay to group if staying under the question limit.

**Form order:**
1.  Questions
2.  Consent question
3.  Contact info (name, email, phone)

**Mobile-friendly:**
* No “wall of text” answers. Test on small screens.

### 📢 4. Ad Copy (Text in Feed/Story Ads)

* **Open with a hook**: Use curiosity-driven, professional openers. Often a question.
* **Short & factual**: ≤ 90 characters before truncation; no fluff, no exaggeration.
* **Benefit-first**: Talk about what candidates gain. Requirements go in the questionnaire.
* **CTA aligned**: Use “Take the 60‑sec test”, “Test now!” or similar. Never “Apply” or variants.
* **Tone check**: Friendly, traceable to client-approved info, and candidate-focused.
* **German (DACH)**: Default CTA = “Testen Sie jetzt, ob diese Stelle zu Ihnen passt.”
    * Headline = benefit or opportunity, avoid generic titles. Avoid "Wurst" grammar.

**Remember: Always Think Like the Candidate**
Focus on what the candidate gains—not what the company demands. Make everything feel friendly, easy, and respectful of their time.

- [ ] Is the CTA consistent?
- [ ] Are all elements visually aligned?
- [ ] Does the Questionnaire flow logically and stay brief?

## Brand Vision

The most effective and humane way to match businesses and people.

The job market is broken. Its friction and legacy processes lead to mismatch and loss of human and business potential.

## Our Mission

We realize potential by matching undiscovered talent with opportunities to ultimately transform organizational cultures.

## Our Solution

We offer a digital recruitment solution for businesses and candidates with an efficient talent acquisition experience. Jobilla provides a personalized strategy to attract passive candidates, reduce recruiting costs, and speed up the recruitment process while offering candidates a way to find jobs that align with their skills and interests.

## Brand Purpose

Our purpose is to make recruitments fast and easy for everybody.
The right person in the right job can make the impossible possible.

## Tone of Voice

Genuinely daring and distilled with a sense of care and humility.

Our tone of voice is genuine and distilled, speaking with care and humility while embracing a daring edge. We communicate with clarity and warmth, unafraid to challenge the norm and inspire new ways of thinking.

>‘‘Great teams don’t happen by chance. We blend cutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of people to connect talent with companies where they’ll thrive. No shortcuts, no compromises— just precision, insight, and the right fit.’’

At Jobilla, we value honesty and straightforward communication, ensuring that both candidates and recruiters get clear, no-nonsense information every step of the way. By prioritizing speed, simplicity, and efficiency, we eliminate unnecessary complexity—making job applications and talent searches seamless. With smart technology and transparent processes, we deliver real opportunities without the guesswork. And at the heart of it all, we’re humans talking to humans, dedicated to helping candidates find the right roles and recruiters connect with the best talent—fast.

## The Baseline

**Potential. Fulfilled.**

‘‘Potential. Fulfilled.’’ refers to the realization or actualization of one’s inherent capabilities, talents, and capacities. It signifies reaching a state where an individual has successfully developed, utilized, and expressed their full range of abilities to achieve personal, professional, or societal goals.

## The Logo

### Logo Variations

* Polychromous logo (Primary)
* Secondary logo
* Monochromous logo

### The Jobibot

### The Concept Behind the Jobibot

The core concept of Jobilla stands behind the efficiency of searching and finding potential candidates for our customer’s recruitment(s). Candidates who apply to jobs sponsored by Jobilla are intuitively added to the recruitment pipeline, allowing the recruiter to move and sort people efficiently in order to reach out quickly and chat with them about potential future collaborations. These 3 strong features of the Jobilla concept have built the skeleton of our mascot, the Jobibot.

### General Usages

**Allowed:**
* Use a greyscale monochromous logo.
* Use a dark purple version of the logo.
* Use the font without the Jobibot.
* Use the Jobibot without the font.

**Not Allowed:**
* Do not add any effect to the logo.
* Do not change the color of any part of the polychromous logo.
* Do not tilt the logo.
* Do not change the font of the logo.
* Do not distort the logo.
* Do not use an outline around the logo.
* Do not change the size between the elements of the logo.
* Do not dismantle the Jobibot or move its elements.

### Usages on a Background

### Depth and Elevation

Elevation in UI enhances visual hierarchy and usability by adding smooth drop shadows to elements. These subtle shadows create a sense of depth, distinguishing interactive components from the background and guiding users’ focus. In our design system, drop shadows are applied only at level 2 elevation, helping key interactive elements stand out without overwhelming the interface.

### UI System Icons

Jobilla's UI icons are thoughtfully designed with usability at the forefront. Each icon is crafted for clarity and simplicity (at 24px), ensuring intuitive navigation and a seamless user experience.

### Color Usages in UI

* **Visuals**: Use the Brand color palette.
* **Texts and interactive elements**: Use the UI color palette.
